All of the group members procrastinated on starting the project. The work began once Jordan created the Trello board and GitHub repository, as well as adding all tasks to the Trello Board. Chandanpreet and Jordan divided the tasks fairly, because at this point Robin had not responded to any messages since the project had been set up. Chandanpreet and Jordan began working on their tasks. Robin messaged the group 3 days before the project was due, explaining how he will not be continuing with the course and how it is up to the two other to complete the project, but he did not want to be excluded from the group. This seemed unfair to the other members, so Jordan messaged back telling him that if Robin did not even attempt the project that he would not be getting credit. Robin said he would try his best, and Jordan helped him begin where he was unsure. Since then, he has not responded to messages. Jordan completed the paragraphs he was supposed to do, those being the "Executive Summary", "Professional Report", and the "Use-Case diagram description". 
Jordan: "Other than the issues with Robin, it was a pleasure working with Chandanpreet. She did everything that she needed to, even with an emergency that occured two days before the due date, and was understanding when the two of them accidentally did their use-case diagram description on the same use case."
Chandanpreet: "It was a great experience working with you as a team you did a great job! Actually all the credits goes to [Jordan] thank you for cooperating with us"
Robin did not respond to messages inquiring if he had anything to add.
